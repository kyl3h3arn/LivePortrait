# LivePortrait Google Cloud Platform Deployment Instructions
## ITCS 6166 - Team 10: </br> Kyle Hearn, Aman Waghchoure, Emil Kozicki, Jake Pinos
-  The goal of this project was to select a service to then be deployed onto a cloud platform for others to access. We chose the service [LivePortrait.](https://github.com/KwaiVGI/LivePortrait/tree/main) Throughout the semester, we had the pleasure of learning the inner workings of LivePortrait, deepening our knowledge in python libraries, deep learning, and more.
-  After trying several services, we decided on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). They offer $300 in free credits for first time users, and allows GPU access upon request.
-  This READme will document the deployment process, for others to follow along with in the future.
